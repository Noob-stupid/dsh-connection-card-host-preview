# dsh-connection-card-host

[中文](README.zh.md) | **English**

> **Let your DSH sessions see each other, talk to each other, and share tools — without getting in each other's way.**

Running several DSH sessions at once (one researching, one coding, one running experiments)
is normal — but they're **isolated**: they can't see what the others are doing, and can't
hand conclusions over.

This plugin makes a **connection** a first-class object in DSH:
**sessions are nodes, a connection is the container, cards are connection-scoped plugins.**

## What it does

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **See each other** | Look up **which files the other session is editing, how far its plan has got, what tools it last used** — collected automatically, no effort required from the other side |
| **Talk to each other** | Send a message with **one of three urgencies you choose**: notify only (no interruption) / queue / interject |
| **Share tools** | Mount **cards** on a connection: a card can provide tools to the sessions, even with tens of MB of real dependencies |
| **Shared premises** | A "convention box" holds what you agreed on: interfaces, units, naming, who owns what |
| **Stay out of the way** | Awareness is **pull-based** — zero cost unless the other side asks. Unrelated connections **never interrupt you** |

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-permission.svg" width="680" alt="Line colour shows the permission in that direction: grey = read-only, blue = can suggest, orange = can write; the two ends can differ" />
</p>

---

## Quick start

1. **Connect**: hold the circle to the left of the composer (or the `…` on a session row)
   and drag it onto a row in the session list.

<tr>

</p>

   - **Toggle semantics**: drop on an unconnected row = connect; drop on an **already
     connected** row = disconnect (the hover hint tells you which)
   - You can also pick two sessions from the "Connections" panel in the sidebar
2. **Done.** Both ends get one quiet notice (who you're connected to, what it enables) —
   **nobody is interrupted**.
3. Want more detail? Open "Connections" in the sidebar, or have the session call
   `connection_peer_work` itself.

Once connected, a **rail** appears beside the session rows, with a **coloured dot at each
end** — that's the permission for that direction:

## Three layers: awareness / conventions / messaging

These are **separate**, because their costs differ enormously:

| Layer | Mechanism | Enters the other's context? | Forces the other to act? | Cost |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **A. Work state** | pull (the other asks) | only when it asks | ❌ no | **0** |
| **B. Convention box** | pull (the other asks) | only when it asks | ❌ no | **0** |
| **C. Messaging** | push (into its inbox) | **unconditionally** | ✅ **always** | every message |

**The key fact**: in DSH, delivering a message **forces the other session to run a turn** —
the agent loop has no "saw it but ignored it" state. So "talking" and "being aware" have to
be built separately: to make the other side **know**, use A/B; only to make it **act**, use C.

### A. Work state (automatic, zero cost)

Collected from runtime events — **it asks nothing extra of the model**:

```
【session-bd5ac1b1】
status: running a command (2s ago)
recently touched: water-boat/src/water.js
progress: turn 69 / step 39
```

### B. Convention box (explicit, zero cost)

What you agreed on: interface signatures, units, coordinate systems, naming, **who owns what**.
Editable in the panel; sessions read and write it with `connection_conventions` / `connection_declare`.

> **Why pull, not push**: pushing slowly fills the other's context, and most of it is
> never needed. Keeping it in a box that the other queries on demand costs zero.

### C. Messaging (three urgencies, **chosen by the sender**)

| Urgency | Under the hood | What the other sees |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `quiet` | `inject` | placed in context **without waking it** — it sees the message next time it works, **uninterrupted** |
| `normal` | `followup` | **queued** — it sees the message once it finishes what it's doing |
| `urgent` | `steer` | **interjected** — inserted into the turn it's **currently running**, read immediately |

`urgent` on an idle peer **degrades to queued** automatically (the next turn starts
immediately, so the effect is the same), and never fails.

> **The rule** (written into the tool description): interrupting has a cost — the other
> session has to drop its current line of thought. Most messages aren't urgent: default to
> `normal`, and use `urgent` only when it genuinely must change behaviour **right now**.

---

## Cards on a connection

**A card = a plugin mounted on a connection, with per-side visibility.**

| | DSH plugin | Card |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Mounted on | the whole DSH (profile) | **one connection** |
| Who can call it | every session | **only sessions on that connection** |
| Visibility | global | **per side**: both / A only / B only |
| Lifetime | DSH start/stop | mounted and unmounted with the connection |

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-card-tool.svg" width="680" alt="A session uses one resident bridge tool to discover and call tools provided by cards, subject to visibility scope" />
</p>

### Cards can provide tools to sessions

Tools registered with `api.registerTool(name, fn)` inside a card are reachable by sessions
on that connection through **one** resident bridge tool:

```
connection_card_tool                                  ← the only resident one (1 schema)
  ├─ no `tool` argument → list the cards and tools visible to *your* side of this connection
  └─ with `tool`        → call it
```

**Why one bridge instead of one schema per tool**: the latter would make **every session**
pay a resident cost for every card tool, while cards are mounted and unmounted dynamically.
The bridge costs one schema, and it's the natural place to enforce visibility.

**Visibility actually blocks**:

```
Side A can see the card      ✅
Side B cannot see it         ✅
Side B calls it anyway       → 「这张卡片只对 A 端可见（你在 B 端）」
```

### Cards can carry real dependencies

A card can carry real dependencies: wrapping a parsing core plus
**pdfjs-dist** as a card, installed under `$DSH_HOME/connection-cards/cards/`,
**without touching the DSH profile**. A session called it through the bridge and got real
parse results back.

### Install and update from the panel

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/shot-card-picker.png" width="620" alt="Card picker: built-in cards install in one click; you can also give a package name, a repo tgz URL or a local directory" />
</p>

- **Install**: package name / repo tgz URL / local directory → into our own directory,
  **no pnpm, no profile changes**
- **Update**: installed cards get a "check for updates" entry with three distinct states
  ```
  「检查更新」→「↑ 更新到 x.y.z」/「已是最新」/「无法检查」
  ```
  **"Couldn't check" is never shown as "up to date"** — that would be lying.

---

## What a card can and cannot do

Any ordinary DSH plugin can be mounted as a card on a connection. Three **static** conditions decide it:

| Condition | Supported | Not supported |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Registers into a **connection-level** location (conversation, input area), or is **capability-only** (no client UI) | Registers into an **app-level** location (sidebar, overall layout, settings page, theme, title bar, workspace) — those are meant to be installed into the app, not onto a connection |
| **Host dependencies** | Everything the **entry actually loads** can be resolved | A real runtime dependency is missing. Install reports it in two classes: missing host capability → the card needs a design change; missing third-party dependency → just add the dependency |
| **Host capabilities** | Uses only `tools` / `effect` / `llm` / `prompt` | Needs other host services (credentials, web server, session control, commands, subprocess, …) — not provided; the mount is **refused with a reason** |

> Only files the **entry actually loads** count: tests, build scripts, CLIs and type declarations are not runtime dependencies.

### Client UI: what works

| Client shape | Result |
|---|---|
| Uses only slot registration and effect hooks (`slots` / `effect`) | **Renders**, and stays interactive |
| Needs more client services (localization, config forms, connection, routing, settings pages) | **Mounts and registers slots, but cannot render** — the panel shows **the specific reason** instead of a blank area |
| Client artifact size | Up to **32 MB** (self-contained bundles with inlined assets are fine) |
| Component props | Components are called **without props** — ones that require slot props will error; the error is contained to that card |

### Badges in the candidate list

Each card carries one badge: **adapter / capability / local / global / undecided**.
It tells you *before* mounting whether a plugin suits a connection — **advisory only, nothing is blocked**.

---

## Architecture and cost

Three layers, with hard boundaries — each talks only to the one below:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Card layer (connection-scoped plugins)                     │
│  Depends only on CardAPI; NEVER imports @deepseek-ai/*      │
│  → DSH upgrades don't affect cards; our CardAPI changes do  │
│    (guarded by a version declaration)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Connection layer (this plugin)                             │
│  connections / permissions / awareness / conventions /      │
│  card host / message delivery                               │
│  → on a DSH upgrade, this is the only layer to change       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  DSH adapter layer (DSHAdapter + allowlist + audit)         │
│  the single exit point for all DSH interaction; we do not   │
│  rewrite DSH's transport, permissions or plugin system      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Permissions are **per direction**

One line, one dot at each end; the colour is the permission **for that direction** — the two
directions are independent, so you can have "A may send, B may only watch":

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-permission.svg" width="640" alt="Line colour shows the permission in that direction: grey = read-only, blue = can suggest, orange = can write; the two ends can differ" />
</p>

**Read-only does not affect awareness**: work state and the convention box are both
**queried by the other side**, independent of permission. Lowering a permission takes effect
immediately; raising one requires confirmation from the side being granted it.

### How card tools reach a session

Tools registered by cards **do not each take a schema** — a session sees **one** resident
bridge, discovers on demand, calls on demand, and visibility is enforced at the bridge:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/demo-card-tool.svg" width="640" alt="A session uses one resident bridge tool to discover and call tools provided by cards, subject to visibility scope" />
</p>

---

### What it costs

| Item | Number | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Awareness (layers A + B)** | **0 context** | pull-based; costs nothing unless the peer queries |
| **Card tools** | **1 resident schema** | instead of one per card tool |
| **Automatic mirroring** | **0 (disabled)** | mostly irrelevant content before it was turned off |
| **Unrelated connections** | **0 interruptions** | connecting doesn't wake anyone; unrelated sessions carry on |

**The one fixed cost**: this plugin's five `connection_*` tools cost roughly **1,700 tokens
resident** — **and only in sessions that have connections**: sessions with none have them
stripped automatically by `system-prompt/assemble` (a 0-connection session has 5
tools removed, logged as `按会话 scope 隐藏了 5 个感知工具`).

---

## Install

**This plugin is not published to npm** (DSH's peer dependencies aren't on the public
registry, so `npm install` is guaranteed to fail — verified). Install from GitHub:

```sh
# Preview line (latest development build — the repo you're reading)
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Noob-stupid/dsh-connection-card-host-preview

# Stable line (the public facade, synced only at release time)
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Noob-stupid/dsh-connection-card-host

# Or a pinned tarball (grab the asset URL from the Releases page)
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/…/releases/download/v1.0.0/noob-stupid-dsh-connection-card-host-1.0.0.tgz
```

> The two `github:` commands above are **verified working** (161 files land in `lib`, using
> the profile's own settings: `autoInstallPeers: false`). The bare names
> `dsh-connection-card-host` and `@noob-stupid/dsh-connection-card-host` both **404** on
> npm and won't work for anyone else — don't use them.

**Compatibility**: `peerDependencies` declares `@deepseek-ai/dsh >=0.2.0-rc.1 <0.3.0` — DSH
**gates on version at install time** and refuses clearly, with a reason, rather than
installing and crashing later.

---

## Use

1. **Create a connection** — pick two sessions in the panel; each direction has its own permissions.
2. **Mount a card** — open a connection, choose a card from the candidate list. It takes effect on
   the side you pick (`A` / `B` / both).
3. **Talk to the peer** — the card's tools become available to that session; messages carry the
   urgency you choose (`quiet` / `normal` / `urgent` / `preempt`).
4. **Unmount** — remove the card from the connection; the card itself stays installed.

### The agent skill ships with the plugin

Installing the plugin is enough: it registers a **`connection-card` skill** through DSH's
skill-provider channel, so any agent in that install finds instructions for the connection
tools in its session catalog — no copying files into `~/.dsh/skills/` and no extra step.

- Source of truth for the text: [`skills/connection-card.md`](skills/connection-card.md).
- It appears while the plugin is loaded and disappears when you uninstall the plugin (the
  registration is bound to the plugin's lifecycle).
- It covers when to use each of the host tools and how to choose an urgency level
  (`quiet` / `normal` / `urgent` / `preempt`).
- Prefer to use it as a plain local skill instead? The same file is a valid flat skill —
  copy it to `~/.dsh/skills/connection-card.md`.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Adapter layer | **off** | Allows ordinary DSH plugins to be mounted as cards. Nothing is touched until you turn it on. |
| Automatic mirroring | **off** | Auto-forwarding session content to the peer. Kept off on purpose (it mostly sends noise). |
| View preferences | per connection | Number of lanes shown on the connection track. |

## Uninstall

- **A card** — the candidate list has an **Uninstall** entry for installed cards (a confirmation
  states how many connections it is mounted on). Built-in cards do not offer it: they ship with the
  plugin and come back on upgrade. What could not be removed is reported honestly.
- **The whole plugin** — remove it from your DSH profile. Cards and connections live under
  `$DSH_HOME/connection-cards/` and are left untouched.

## FAQ

**Do I need to install anything for cards?**
No. Cards install into the plugin's own directory; no `pnpm` runs in your profile and your DSH
profile is not modified.

**A plugin will not mount. Why?**
The refusal names the class: host capability (the card needs something this plugin does not
provide) or third-party dependency (the dependency is missing). The first requires a change on the
card side; the second can be fixed by shipping the dependency with the card.

**A mounted card shows no UI.**
Its client half needs client services beyond slots/effect. The panel shows the exact reason — it is
not a blank screen.

**Does mounting a card change my DSH install?**
No. It does not rewrite DSH, does not touch your profile, and can be undone at any time.

## Writing a card

A card is just an npm package with a `dshCard` manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "my-card",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dshCard": { "id": "my-card", "name": "My card", "entry": "index.js", "api": 1 }
}
```

```js
// index.js — NEVER import anything from @deepseek-ai/*; go through `api`
export function apply(api) {
  api.log(`mounted (scope=${api.scope})`)

  // provide a tool to sessions on the connection
  api.registerTool('greet', async (args) => {
    return `Hello, ${args?.name ?? 'world'}`
  })
}

// panel HTML (optional)
export function renderPanel(api) {
  return `<div>visible to: ${api.scope}</div>`
}
```

| `api` member | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `registerTool(name, fn)` | register a tool → sessions call it via `connection_card_tool` |
| `send(kind, text)` / `read()` | send and receive connection messages as one side |
| `on(event, handler)` / `emit(event, data)` | connection-scoped events |
| `scope` | which side this instance serves (`both` / `a` / `b`) |
| `log(...)` | write to the host log |

**`dshCard.api`** declares the **CardAPI version** the card needs (defaults to 1):

- **Adding things does not bump the version** — older cards keep working
- **Only removals or semantic changes bump it** — the host refuses to mount a card that
  requires a newer version, and says why

> This is **our own compatibility guard**: cards don't depend on DSH internals, so a DSH
> upgrade doesn't affect them; but **changing our `CardAPI` does** — and DSH's version gate
> can't see that layer.

See [`docs/card-protocol.md`](docs/card-protocol.md) for details.

## Maintenance

**Implemented**

- Connections: drag to connect (toggle semantics), three sessions fully interconnected,
  persistence and restore across restarts
- Permissions: three levels per direction, asymmetric, upgrades need the other side's
  confirmation, refusals explain themselves
- Awareness A: work state collected automatically (0 context)
- Conventions B: the convention box (0 context)
- Messaging C: three urgencies, with automatic degradation
- Cards: template discovery / mounting / per-side visibility / in-panel install /
  **update** / crash isolation
- Card tools: bridge invocation with enforced visibility
- Card directories are **versioned** (so a mounted card can still be updated)
- **Per-session tool scoping**: sessions with no connections do **not** carry the `connection_*` schemas (~1,700 tokens saved), via the official `system-prompt/assemble` waterfall; the whole chain is **fail-open** — **behaviour introduced in `v1.0.1`** (`v1.0.0` registers them globally)

**Known gaps**

| Item | Notes |
|:---|:---|
| `mountUI` / `requestRemote` | Interface in place, implementation pending (`mountUI` currently only sets a dataset attribute) |
| Card tool schemas | Deliberately take no separate schema; callers must list before calling |
| **Rail layering trade-off** | The rail is portaled onto `document.body` — **decoupled from slot containers**, which is the only way to keep someone else's skin/overlay from beating it via stacking context (`z-index` is only comparable *within* one stacking context). The cost: it always sits at body level, so a future "must be on top" full-screen modal would have the rail drawn over it. `pointer-events: none` keeps interaction unaffected, so the risk is low; if it ever needs tightening, the suggested fix is a **minimal predicate** — while `[role="dialog"][aria-modal="true"]` is present, drop the rail below that modal and restore when it closes (**not** an unconditional hide) |
